## PROJECT OVERVIEW  
Build a **developer-focused SaaS platform** where users can **create**, **sell**, and **enroll** in video-based technical courses. Each user may register as a `mentor` or `learner` and should have access only to their permitted features.

This project simulates a real-world product like **Udemy / Teachable** but scoped down for a 7-day full-stack challenge.
